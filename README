Note: The OpenWeatherMap service now requires an API key where previously
      it did not. FOSS developers can register for a free API key
      which needs to be put into app/data/keys.js for the app to 
      function correctly. Do not commit branches with the key in place
      as a centrally managed key is injected at build time.

      See http://openweathermap.org/faq#error401 for details and
      http://openweathermap.org/appid to obtain a personal key.

The following essential packages are required to develop this app:
- ubuntu-sdk (see http://developer.ubuntu.com/start)
- intltool - run the `sudo apt-get install intltool` command for installation

See the debian/control file for an up-to-date list of dependencies
